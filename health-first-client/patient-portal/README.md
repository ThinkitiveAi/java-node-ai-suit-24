const handleLogin = async (credentials) => {
  // API call to authenticate user
  const response = await api.login(credentials);
  // Handle response and set authentication state
};
```

### Appointment Management
```javascript
// TODO: Replace with actual API calls
const bookAppointment = async (appointmentData) => {
  // API call to book appointment
  const response = await api.bookAppointment(appointmentData);
  // Handle response and update UI
};
```

### Availability Management
```javascript
// TODO: Replace with actual API calls
const updateAvailability = async (slotData) => {
  // API call to update provider availability
  const response = await api.updateAvailability(slotData);
  // Handle response and refresh calendar
};
```
